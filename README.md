# San Francisco Slow Streets

Recently the San Francisco announced a "slow streets" program to designated certain streets for walking, wheelchair rolling, and biking. 

Twelve locations around the city were initially chosen for phase 1. This map highlights these corridors.

Inspired by [Sidewalk Widths NYC](https://github.com/meliharvey/sidewalkwidths-nyc), the map also identifies sidewalk widths around the city, which could further help prioritize locations.

 [San Francisco's sidewalk data](https://data.sfgov.org/Transportation/Sidewalk-Widths/4g86-grxu) and [Street data](https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Streets-Active-and-Retired/3psu-pn9h) were used to create the map.
